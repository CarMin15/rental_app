This is my first JavaScript project.

My goal here was to learn from the best and implement a real world application while having fun! :)

Project goals:
- Apply what I have learned reading JS books and with TreeHouse
- Retrieve data from an API using AJAX requests
- Use a templating system (Handlebars)
- Manipulate dates with moment.js
- Improve my JQuery skills
- Learn the Google Maps API
- Implement a slideshow
- Implement a calendar

Features:
- Load cities from an API
- Get rentals from an API after retrieving data from a form
- Display rental items in a list and on a map
- Display rental images using a slideshow
- Show rental details within the map by clicking on a marker
- Update rental listing when changing city

A demo of the project is hosted here: http://maria.commitd.io/rental_app
